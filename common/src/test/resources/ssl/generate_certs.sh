# A simple utility to (re-)generate the files within resources/ssl
# These generated certificates are used for a variety of test scenarios for SSL.
# The utility ends up generating two certificates - which are saved into two different keystores
# The certificates generated are signed by two different CA cert's (also generated here).
# There are two truststores generated - the first truststore has both CA certs as part of it
# Hence this trust can be used to validate both client certificates.
# The second trust store has NO CA certs in it - and so when used will fail both the certificates.
