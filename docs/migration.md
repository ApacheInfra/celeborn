# Migration Guide

## Upgrading from 0.2.1 to 0.3.0

 - From 0.3.0 on the default value for `celeborn.client.push.replicate.enabled` is changed from `true` to `false`, users
   who want replication on should explicitly enable replication. For example, to enable replication for Spark
   users should add the spark config when submitting job: `spark.celeborn.client.push.replicate.enabled=true`

 - From 0.3.0 on the default value for `celeborn.worker.storage.workingDir` is changed from `hadoop/rss-worker/shuffle_data` to `rss-worker/shuffle_data`,
   users who want to use origin working dir path should set this configuration.

 - Since 0.3.0, configuration namespace `celeborn.ha.master` is deprecated, and will be removed in the future versions.
   All configurations `celeborn.ha.master.*` should migrate to `celeborn.master.ha.*`.

 - Since 0.3.0, environment variables `CELEBORN_MASTER_HOST` and `CELEBORN_MASTER_PORT` are removed.
   Instead `CELEBORN_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` works on both master and worker, which takes high priority than configurations defined in properties file.

 - Since 0.3.0, the Celeborn Master URL schema is changed from `rss://` to `celeborn://`, for users who start Worker by
   `sbin/start-worker.sh rss://<master-host>:<master-port>`, should migrate to `sbin/start-worker.sh celeborn://<master-host>:<master-port>`.

 - When using 0.2.1 as client side and 0.3.0 as server side, you may see the following Exception in LifecycleManger's
   log. You can safely ignore the log, it's caused by the behavior change when Master receives heartbeat from Application.

 - Since 0.3.0, Celeborn supports overriding Hadoop configuration(`core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, etc.) from Celeborn configuration with the additional prefix `celeborn.hadoop.`. 
   On Spark client side, user should set Hadoop configuration like `spark.celeborn.hadoop.foo=bar`, note that `spark.hadoop.foo=bar` does not take effect;
   on Flink client and Celeborn Master/Worker side, user should set like `celeborn.hadoop.foo=bar`.
