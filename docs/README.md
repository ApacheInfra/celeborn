Quick Start
===
This documentation gives a quick start guide for running Apache Spark with Apache Celeborn(Incubating).

### Download Celeborn
Download the latest Celeborn binary from the [Downloading Page](https://celeborn.apache.org/download/).
Decompress the binary and set `$CELEBORN_HOME`
```shell
tar -C <DST_DIR> -zxvf apache-celeborn-<VERSION>-bin.tgz
export $CELEBORN_HOME=<Decompressed path>
```

## Configure Logging and Storage
#### Configure Logging
```shell
cd $CELEBORN_HOME/conf
cp log4j2.xml.template log4j2.xml
```
#### Configure Storage
Configure the directory to store shuffle data, for example `$CELEBORN_HOME/shuffle`
```shell
cd $CELEBORN_HOME/conf
echo "celeborn.worker.storage.dirs=$CELEBORN_HOME/shuffle" > celeborn-defaults.conf
```

## Start Celeborn Service
#### Start Master
```shell
cd $CELEBORN_HOME
./sbin/start-master.sh
```
You should see `Master`'s ip:port in the log:
```log
INFO [main] NettyRpcEnvFactory: Starting RPC Server [MasterSys] on 192.168.2.109:9097
```
#### Start Worker
Use the Master's IP and Port to start Worker:
```shell
cd $CELEBORN_HOME
./sbin/start-worker.sh celeborn://<Master IP>:<Master Port>
```
You should see the following message in Worker's log:
```log
INFO [main] MasterClient: connect to master 192.168.2.109:9097.
INFO [main] Worker: Register worker successfully.
```
And also the following message in Master's log:
```log
INFO [dispatcher-event-loop-9] Master: Registered worker
Host: 192.168.2.109
RpcPort: 57806
PushPort: 57807
FetchPort: 57809
ReplicatePort: 57808
SlotsUsed: 0
LastHeartbeat: 0
HeartbeatElapsedSeconds: xxx
Disks:
  DiskInfo0: xxx
UserResourceConsumption: empty
WorkerRef: null
```

## Start Spark with Celeborn
#### Copy Celeborn Client to Spark's jars
Celeborn release binary contains clients for Spark 2.x and Spark 3.x, copy the corresponding client jar into Spark's
`jars/` directory:
```shell
cp $CELEBORN_HOME/spark/<Celeborn Client Jar> $SPARK_HOME/jars/
```
#### Start spark-shell
Set `spark.shuffle.manager` to Celeborn's ShuffleManager, and turn off `spark.shuffle.service.enabled`:
```shell
cd $SPARK_HOME

./bin/spark-shell \
--conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.celeborn.SparkShuffleManager \
--conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=false
```
Then run the following test case:
```scala
spark.sparkContext
  .parallelize(1 to 10, 10)
  .flatMap(_ => (1 to 100).iterator.map(num => num))
  .repartition(10)
  .count
```
During the Spark Job, you should see the following message in Celeborn Master's log:
```log
Master: Offer slots successfully for 10 reducers of local-1690000152711-0 on 1 workers.
```
And the following message in Celeborn Worker's log:
```log
INFO [dispatcher-event-loop-9] Controller: Reserved 10 primary location and 0 replica location for local-1690000152711-0
INFO [dispatcher-event-loop-8] Controller: Start commitFiles for local-1690000152711-0
INFO [async-reply] Controller: CommitFiles for local-1690000152711-0 success with 10 committed primary partitions, 0 empty primary partitions, 0 failed primary partitions, 0 committed replica partitions, 0 empty replica partitions, 0 failed replica partitions.
```
