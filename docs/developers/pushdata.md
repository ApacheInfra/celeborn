# Push Data

This article describes the detailed design of the process of push data.

## API specification
The push data API is as follows:
```java
  public abstract int pushData(
      int shuffleId,
      int mapId,
      int attemptId,
      int partitionId,
      byte[] data,
      int offset,
      int length,
      int numMappers,
      int numPartitions)
      throws IOException;
```

- `shuffleId` is the unique shuffle id of the application
- `mapId` is the map id of the shuffle
- `attemptId` is the attempt id of the map task, i.e. speculative task or task rerun for Apache Spark
- `partitionId` is the partition id the data belongs to
- `data`,`offset`,`length` specifies the bytes to be pushed
- `numMappers` is the number map tasks in the shuffle
- `numPartitions` is the number of partitions in the shuffle

## Lazy Shuffle Register
The first time `pushData` is called, Client will check whether the shuffle id has been registered. If not,
it sends `RegisterShuffle` to `LifecycleManager`, `LifecycleManager` then sends `RequestSlots` to `Master`.
`RequestSlots` specifies how many `PartitionLocation`s this shuffle requires, each `PartitionLocation` logically
responds to data of some partition id.

Upon receiving `RequestSlots`, `Master` allocates slots for the shuffle among `Worker`s. If replication is turned on,
`Master` allocates a pair of `Worker`s for each `PartitionLocation` to store two replicas for each `PartitionLocation`.
The detailed allocation strategy can be found in [Slots Allocation](../../developers/slotsallocation). `Master` then
responds to `LifecycleManager` with the allocated `PartitionLocation`s.

`LifcycleManager` caches the `PartitionLocation`s for the shuffle and responds to each `RegisterShuffle` RPCs from
`ShuffleClient`s.

## Normal Push
In normal cases, the process of pushing data is as follows:

- `ShuffleClient` compresses data, currently supports `zstd` and `lz4`
- `ShuffleClient` addes Header for the data: `mapId`, `attemptId`, `batchId` and `size`. The `bastchId` is a unique
  id for the data batch inside the (`mapId`, `attemptId`), for the purpose of de-duplication
- `ShuffleClient` sends `PushData` to the `Worker` on which the current `PartitionLocation` is allocated, and holds push
  state for this pushing
- `Worker` receives the data, do replication if needed, then responds success ACK to `ShuffleClient`. For more details
  about how data is replicated and stored in `Worker`s, please refer to [Worker](../../developers/worker)
- Upon receiving success ACK from `Worker`, `ShuffleClient` considers success for this pushing and modifies the push state

## Push or Merge?
If the size of data to be pushed is small, say hundreds of bytes, it will be very inefficient to send to the wire.
So `ShuffleClient` offers another API: `mergeData` to batch data locally before sending to `Worker`.

`mergeData` merges data with the same target into `DataBatches`. `Same target` means the destination for both the
primary and replica are the same. When the size of a `DataBatches` exceeds a threshold (defaults to`64KiB`),
`ShuffleClient` triggers pushing and sends `PushMergedData` to the destination.

Upon receiving `PushMergedData`, `Worker` unpacks it into data segments each for a specific `PartitionLocation`, then
stores them accordingly.

## Async Push
Celeborn's `ShuffleClient` does not block compute engine's execution by asynchronous pushing, implemented in
`DataPusher`.

Whenever compute engine decides to push data, it calls `DataPusher#addTask`, `DataPusher` creates a `PushTask` which
contains the data, and added the `PushTask` in a non-blocking queue. `DataPusher` continuously poll the queue
and invokes `ShuffleClient#pushData` to do actual push.

## Split
As mentioned before, Celeborn will split a `PartitionLocation` when any of the following conditions happens:

- `PartitionLocation` file exceeds threshold (defaults to 1GiB)
- Usable space of local disk is less than threshold (defaults to 5GiB)
- `Worker` is in `Graceful Shutdown` state
- Push data fails

For the first three cases, `Worker` informs `ShuffleClient` that it should trigger split; for the last case,
`ShuffleClient` triggers split itself.

There are two kinds of Split:

- `HARD_SPLIT`, meaning old `PartitionLocation` epoch refuses to accept any data, and future data of the
  `PartitionLocation` will only be pushed after new `PartitionLocation` epoch is ready
- `SOFT_SPLIT`, meaning old `PartitionLocation` epoch continues to accept data, when new epoch is ready, `ShuffleClient`
  switches to the new location transparently

The process of `SOFT_SPLIT` is as follows:

`LifecycleManager` keeps the split information and tells reducer to read from all splits of the `PartitionLocation`
to guarantee no data is lost.
