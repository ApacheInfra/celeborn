| Key | Default | Description | Since |
| --- | ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| celeborn.master.endpoints | <localhost>:9097 | Endpoints of master nodes for celeborn client to connect, allowed pattern is: `<host1>:<port1>[,<host2>:<port2>]*`, e.g. `clb1:9097,clb2:9098,clb3:9099`. If the port is omitted, 9097 will be used. | 0.2.0 | 
| celeborn.metrics.enabled | true | When true, enable metrics system. |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.sample.rate | 1.0 |  |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.timer.sliding.size | 4000 |  |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.timer.sliding.window.size | 4096 |  |  | 
| celeborn.shuffle.chuck.size | 8m | Max chunk size of reducer's merged shuffle data. For example, if a reducer's shuffle data is 128M and the data will need 16 fetch chunk requests to fetch. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.commit.threads | 32 | Thread number of worker to commit shuffle data files asynchronously. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.deviceMonitor.checklist | readwrite,diskusage | Select what the device needs to detect, available items are: iohang, readwrite and diskusage. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.deviceMonitor.enabled | true | When true, worker will monitor device and report to master. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.flush.buffer.size | 256k | Size of buffer used by a single flusher. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.heartbeat.timeout | 120s | Worker heartbeat timeout. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.host | 0.0.0.0 |  |  | 
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.port | 9096 |  |  | 
| celeborn.worker.replicate.threads | 64 | Thread number of worker to replicate shuffle data. |  | 
| celeborn.worker.storage.dirs | <undefined> | Directory list to store shuffle data. It's recommended to configure one directory on each disk. Storage size limit can be set for each directory. For the sake of performance, there should be no more than 2 flush threads on the same disk partition if you are using HDD, and should be 8 or more flush threads on the same disk partition if you are using SSD. For example: dir1[:capacity=][:disktype=][:flushthread=],dir2[:capacity=][:disktype=][:flushthread=] |  |
